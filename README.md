Years ago, I taught at a music academy while composing original music for film and video games on the side.  I have since changed career paths, but I still enjoy writing music when time allows.

This page collects all of my unused songs.  Most were originally written as spec pieces for film or video game projects that didn't work out.  Rather than let them rot away on a backup drive, I'm sharing them here for free use in your own projects.

All of the music is provided under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License](https://github.com/tannerhelland/free-music/blob/master/LICENSE.md). This allows you to use the music anywhere you like, as long as you provide proper attribution (something like "music by Tanner Helland" and a link to this page is fine).  

You can browse and download individual songs by clicking through the file list above, or you can [download the full collection from the releases page (zip file, ~680 MB)](https://github.com/tannerhelland/free-music/releases).

For various unrelated technical reasons (including my own laziness), not all songs are available in all formats.  At present, most songs are available as mp3s and MIDIs, with a smaller percentage also available in ogg (and an even smaller percentage of available in flac).
