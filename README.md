Free original music (mp3, ogg, MIDI, FLAC)
==========================================

Years ago, I taught at a music academy while composing original music for film and video games on the side.  I ultimately changed career paths, but I still enjoy writing music when time allows.

This page collects all of my unused songs.  Most of these were originally written as spec pieces for film or video game projects that didn't reach completion.  Rather than keep the music hidden in a desk drawer, I'm sharing them here for free use in anyone's projects.

All of my original music is provided under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). This allows you to use the songs anywhere you like, as long as you provide proper attribution (something like “music by Tanner Helland” and a link to this page is great).

Songs are organized by format.  For various technical reasons, not all songs are available in all formats, but nearly all songs are available as mp3s and MIDIs.
